Simple interaction with our shrink.

## Haiku

## Syllogisms

Simple implementation of this deductive reasoning, forming a conclusion from  premises like: All humans are mortal, Socrates is human -> Conclusion : Socrates is mortal.

## Pathfinding Algorithms

Several implementations of pathfinding algorithms including:

- Graph Based
- Grid Based
- Hexagon Based

## Expert System

Allows to create a databse which will be query for the best match.
