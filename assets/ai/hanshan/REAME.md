Example poems you might get:
I climb the mountain path alone
sometimes white clouds gather and disperse
each day my shadow is my only companion
this is enough
People ask me why I live here
the stream mutters to itself below
but I've learned the language of silence
at night the moon understands better than people
honestly I wouldn't trade places with anyone
The generator creates poems that feel like genuine Hanshan - contemplative, conversational, with that characteristic blend of earthiness and enlightenment. Each poem has the feeling of a hermit casually sharing observations about mountain life and spiritual practice.
